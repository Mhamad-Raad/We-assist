# WE Assist

is mobile application system where there are two users (Constractors, FreeLancers)
constractor gets to share orders to the free lancers availble.
the free lancers can see description of each order and if its available accept it.
each can see the order status and their order histories.
the freelancer can see the constructors location on the map to deliver the order to them if needed. 

as always there are some small bugs but i will hopefully fix them in the future.

i hope you like it <3
